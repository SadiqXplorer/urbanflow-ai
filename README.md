# 🚦 UrbanFlow AI

Open-Source Urban Congestion Forecasting Platform for Indian Cities

---

## 📌 Overview

UrbanFlow AI is a machine learning-powered urban congestion forecasting system designed to analyze and predict traffic patterns in Indian cities.

Unlike traditional navigation applications that only display real-time traffic, UrbanFlow AI focuses on:

- Historical traffic trend analysis  
- Congestion forecasting  
- Heatmap visualization  
- Data-driven urban insights  

This project is built as a Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) initiative.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban congestion in Indian cities leads to:

- Productivity loss  
- Increased pollution  
- Fuel wastage  
- Infrastructure stress  

Most existing solutions provide real-time traffic updates but do not offer transparent predictive congestion intelligence for planning and analysis.

UrbanFlow AI aims to bridge this gap using machine learning-based forecasting.
